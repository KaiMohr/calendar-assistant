# calendar assistant

A command-line tool to help you manage your Google Calendar.

- easily join the videoconference for your current meeting
- see yours and others' "availability" suitable for an email response
- set up all-day events to let people know where you are (for frequent travelers)
- see views on your calendar events for a date or time range
- book (and re-book) one-on-ones and other meetings automatically

[![Concourse CI](https://ci.nokogiri.org/api/v1/teams/calendar-assistants/pipelines/calendar-assistant/jobs/rake-spec/badge)](https://ci.nokogiri.org/teams/calendar-assistants/pipelines/calendar-assistant)
[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/3525792e1feeccfd8875/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/flavorjones/calendar-assistant/maintainability)


## Setup

First install the gem: `gem install calendar-assistant`.

Head to [the Google API quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/ruby) to enable the Calendar API for your Google account and create a new "project". Save the project info in `~/.calendar-assistant.client`.

Then run `calendar-assistant authorize PROFILE_NAME` (see below for details).


## Features

### Pretty Display in Your Terminal

Events are nicely formatted, with faint strikeouts for events you've declined, and some additional attributes listed when present (e.g., "awaiting", "self", "not-busy", "1:1" ...)


### Human-Friendly Date and Time Specification

All dates and times are interpreted by [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic) and so can be fuzzy terms like "tomorrow", "tuesday", "next thursday", and "two days from now" as well as specific dates and times.

For a date range or a datetime range, split the start and end with `..` or `...` (with or without spaces) like:

* "tomorrow ... three days from now"
* "2018-09-24..2018-09-27".

Also note that every command will adopt an intelligent default, which is generally "today" or "now".


### Human-Friendly Duration Specification

Some duration-related preferences are interpreted by [ChronicDuration](https://github.com/henrypoydar/chronic_duration) and so can be terms like "10m", "30 minutes", "four hours", etc.


### Preferences

All tokens and preferences will be stored in `~/.calendar-assistant` which is in TOML format for easy editing.

</pre>


### Join a video call attached to a meeting

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant join [TIME]

Options:
          [--join], [--no-join]    # launch a browser to join the video call URL
                                   # Default: true

          [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Open the URL for a video call attached to your meeting at time TIME (default 'now')
</pre>

Some examples:

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant join
2018-09-28  11:30 - 12:00 | Status Meeting (recurring)
https://pivotal.zoom.us/j/ABC90210
  # ... and opens the URL, which is associated with an event happening now

<b>$</b> calendar-assistant join work 11:30 --no-join

### Find your availability for meetings

This is useful for emailing people your availability. It only considers `accepted` meetings when determining busy/free.

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant availability [DATE | DATERANGE | TIMERANGE]

Options:
  -l, [--meeting-length=LENGTH]    # [default 30m] find chunks of available time at least as long as LENGTH (which is a ChronicDuration string like '30m' or '2h')
  -s, [--start-of-day=TIME]        # [default 9am] find chunks of available time after TIME (which is a BusinessTime string like '9am' or '14:30')
  -e, [--end-of-day=TIME]          # [default 6pm] find chunks of available time before TIME (which is a BusinessTime string like '9am' or '14:30')
  -z, [--timezone=TIMEZONE]        # [default is calendar tz] find chunks of available time in TIMEZONE (e.g., 'America/New_York')
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]          # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -h, -?, [--help], [--no-help]    
          [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Show your availability for a date or range of dates (default 'today')
</pre>


For example: show me my available time over a chunk of time:

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant avail 2018-10-02..2018-10-04
<i>me@example.com
- all times in America/New_York
- looking for blocks at least 30 mins long
- between 9am and 6pm in America/New_York
</i>
<b>Availability on Tuesday, October 2:
</b>
 â€¢ 11:25am - 12:00pm
 â€¢ 1:30pm - 3:00pm
 â€¢ 3:30pm - 4:00pm

<b>Availability on Wednesday, October 3:
</b>
 â€¢ 9:00am - 10:30am
 â€¢ 11:00am - 1:30pm
 â€¢ 1:55pm - 2:30pm
 â€¢ 2:55pm - 3:30pm

<b>Availability on Thursday, October 4:
</b>
 â€¢ 10:55am - 1:00pm
</pre>


You can also set start and end times for the search, which is useful when looking for overlap with another time zone:

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant avail 2018-10-02..2018-10-04 -s 12pm -e 7pm
<i>me@example.com
- all times in America/New_York
- looking for blocks at least 30 mins long
- between 12pm and 7pm in America/New_York
</i>
<b>Availability on Tuesday, October 2:
</b>
 â€¢ 1:30pm - 3:00pm
 â€¢ 3:30pm - 4:00pm
 â€¢ 6:25pm - 7:00pm

<b>Availability on Wednesday, October 3:
</b>
 â€¢ 12:00pm - 1:30pm
 â€¢ 1:55pm - 2:30pm
 â€¢ 2:55pm - 3:30pm
 â€¢ 6:00pm - 7:00pm

<b>Availability on Thursday, October 4:
</b>
 â€¢ 12:00pm - 1:00pm
 â€¢ 6:00pm - 7:00pm
</pre>


### Tell people where you are at in the world

Declare your location as an all-day non-busy event:

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant location-set LOCATION [DATE | DATERANGE]

Options:
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]          # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -h, -?, [--help], [--no-help]    
          [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Set your location to LOCATION for a date or range of dates (default 'today')
</pre>

**Note** that you can only be in one place at a time, so existing location events may be modified or deleted when new overlapping events are created.

Some examples:

<pre>
# create an event titled `ðŸ—º WFH` for today
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location set -p home WFH
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-03                | <b>ðŸ—º  WFH</b> (not-busy, self)

# create an event titled `ðŸ—º OOO` for tomorrow
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location-set OOO tomorrow
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-04                | <b>ðŸ—º  OOO</b> (not-busy, self)

# create an event titled `ðŸ—º Spring One` on the days of that conference
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location-set "Spring One" 2018-09-24...2018-09-27
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-24 - 2018-09-27   | <b>ðŸ—º  Spring One</b> (not-busy, self)

# create a vacation event for next week
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location-set "Vacation!" "next monday ... next week friday"
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-10 - 2018-09-14   | <b>ðŸ—º  Vacation!</b> (not-busy, self)
</pre>


### Look up where you're going to be

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant location [DATE | DATERANGE]

Options:
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]          # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -h, -?, [--help], [--no-help]    
          [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Show your location for a date or range of dates (default 'today')
</pre>

For example:

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location "2018-09-24...2018-09-28"
<i>me@example.com (all times in America/New_York)
</i>
2018-09-24 - 2018-09-27  <b> | ðŸ—º Mines of Moria </b><i> (not-busy, self)</i>
2018-09-28               <b> | ðŸ—º Goblin Gate </b><i> (not-busy, self)</i>
</pre>


### Display your calendar events

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant show [DATE | DATERANGE | TIMERANGE]

Options:
  -c, [--commitments], [--no-commitments]  # only show events that you've accepted with another person
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]                  # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -h, -?, [--help], [--no-help]            
          [--debug], [--no-debug]          # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Show your events for a date or range of dates (default 'today')
</pre>

### Authorize access to your Google Calendar

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant authorize PROFILE_NAME

Options:
  -h, -?, [--help], [--no-help]    
          [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Description:
  Create and authorize a named profile (e.g., "work", "home", "me@example.com") to access your calendar.

  When setting up a profile, you'll be asked to visit a URL to authenticate, grant authorization, and generate and persist an access token.

  In order for this to work, you'll need to have set up your API client credentials. Run `calendar-assistant help setup` for instructions.
</pre>

This command will generate a URL which you should load in your browser while logged in as the Google account you wish to authorize. Generate a token, and paste the token back into `calendar-assistant`.

Your access token will be stored in `~/.calendar-assistant` in the `[tokens]` section.


### View your configuration parameters

Calendar Assistant has intelligent defaults, which can be overridden in the TOML file `~/.calendar-assistant`, and further overridden via command-line parameters. Sometimes it's nice to be able to see what defaults Calendar Assistant is using:

<pre>
Usage:
  calendar-assistant config

Options:
  -h, -?, [--help], [--no-help]    
          [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Dump your configuration parameters (merge of defaults and overrides from /home/flavorjones/.calendar-assistant)
</pre>

The output is TOML, which is suitable for dumping into `~/.calendar-assistant` and editing.

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant config

[settings]
end-of-day = "6pm"
meeting-length = "30m"
profile = "work"
start-of-day = "9am"
</pre>
