# calendar assistant

A command-line tool to help me manage my Google Calendar.

- book (and re-book) one-on-ones and other meetings automatically
- set up all-day events to let people know your location in the world
- easily join the videoconference for your current meeting

[![Concourse CI](https://ci.nokogiri.org/api/v1/teams/calendar-assistants/pipelines/calendar-assistant/jobs/rake-spec/badge)](https://ci.nokogiri.org/teams/calendar-assistants/pipelines/calendar-assistant)

## Usage

Head to [the quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/ruby) to enable the Calendar API for your Google account and create a new "project". Save the project info in `credentials.json`.

Then run `calendar-assistant authorize PROFILE_NAME` (see below for details).

Once you're authorized, feel free to delete the `credentials.json` file. You can re-download that info again if you ever need it.


## Features

### Pretty Display

Events are nicely formatted, with faint strikeouts for events you've declined, and some additional attributes listed when present (e.g., "needsAction", "self", "not-busy", "1:1" ...)


### Date and Time Specification

All dates and times are interpreted by [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic) and so can be fuzzy terms like "tomorrow", "tuesday", "next thursday", and "two days from now" as well as specific dates and times.

For a date range or a datetime range, split the start and end with `..` or `...` (with or without spaces) like:

* "tomorrow ... three days from now"
* "2018-09-24..2018-09-27".

Also note that every command will adopt an intelligent default, which is generally "today" or "now".


### Preferences

All tokens and preferences will be stored in `~/.calendar-assistant` which is in TOML format.


### Commands

#### Authorize access to your Google Calendar

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant help authorize
Usage:
  calendar-assistant authorize PROFILE_NAME

Options:
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]      # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -d, [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Description:
  Create and authorize a named profile (e.g., "work", "home", "flastname@company.tld") to access your calendar.

  When setting up a profile, you'll be asked to visit a URL to authenticate, grant authorization, and generate and persist an access token.

  In order for this to work, you'll need to follow the instructions at this URL first:

  > https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/ruby

  Namely, the prerequisites are: 
   1. Turn on the Google API for your account 
   2. Create a new Google API Project 
   3. Download the configuration file for the Project, and name it as `credentials.json`

</pre>

This command will generate a URL which you should load in your browser while logged in as the Google account you wish to authorize. Generate a token, and paste the token back into `calendar-assistant`.

Your access token will be stored in `~/.calendar-assistant` in the `[tokens]` section.


#### Display your calendar events

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant help show
Usage:
  calendar-assistant show [DATE | DATERANGE | TIMERANGE]

Options:
  -c, [--commitments], [--no-commitments]  # only show events that you've accepted with another person
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]                  # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -d, [--debug], [--no-debug]              # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Show your events for a date or range of dates (default 'today')

</pre>

For example: display all events scheduled for tomorrow:

<pre>

#### Tell people where you are at in the world

Declare your location as an all-day non-busy event:

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant help location-set
Usage:
  calendar-assistant location-set LOCATION [DATE | DATERANGE]

Options:
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]      # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -d, [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

Set your location to LOCATION for a date or range of dates (default 'today')

</pre>

**Note** that you can only be in one place at a time, so existing location events may be modified or deleted when new overlapping events are created.

Some examples:

<pre>
# create an event titled `ðŸ—º WFH` for today
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location set -p home WFH
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-03                | <b>ðŸ—º  WFH</b> (not-busy, self)

# create an event titled `ðŸ—º OOO` for tomorrow
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location-set OOO tomorrow
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-04                | <b>ðŸ—º  OOO</b> (not-busy, self)

# create an event titled `ðŸ—º Spring One` on the days of that conference
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location-set "Spring One" 2018-09-24...2018-09-27
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-24 - 2018-09-27   | <b>ðŸ—º  Spring One</b> (not-busy, self)

# create a vacation event for next week
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant location-set "Vacation!" "next monday ... next week friday"
<b>Created:</b>
2018-09-10 - 2018-09-14   | <b>ðŸ—º  Vacation!</b> (not-busy, self)
</pre>

#### Look up where you're going to be

<pre>
<b>$</b> calendar-assistant help location

  calendar-assistant location [DATE | DATERANGE]

Options:
  -p, [--profile=PROFILE]      # the profile you'd like to use (if different from default)
  -d, [--debug], [--no-debug]  # how dare you suggest there are bugs

</pre>
