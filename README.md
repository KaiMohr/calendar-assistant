# calendar assistant

A project to help me book (and re-book) one-on-ones and other meetings automatically.

## Features

Practing Readme-Driven-Development (RDD), some features I'd like to build are:

- create all-day (non-busy) events indicating where in the world I am
- create variations on 1:1s
  - every N weeks for 30 minutes
  - every N weeks alternating 30 and 60 minutes
  - alternating 2:1 with 1:1s between two people
  - preference for start-of-day (breakfast) or end-of-day (pub)
  - one-time 1:1 within a time period
  - pool of people with repeating time slot (e.g. all CF Eng managers)
- block off time when a day approaches full
  - optimize for big blocks of time
