# TODO

## Experiments

- [x] how do I authenticate without writing creds to disk
- [x] can I determine people's native timezones
- [-] can I resolve email address to a person's name
- [x] can I see other people's busy/free status


## Notes

If an event is only visible via free/busy status, it will be `visibility: private`

It looks like events we can see are only those that are `status: confirmed`
