# TODO

## User onboarding experience

use https://github.com/gsuitedevs/ruby-samples/blob/master/calendar/quickstart/quickstart.rb

store tokens in a file in the home directory, set permissions appropriately


## then

- convert location events to use google's API, removing northworld's gem
- explore 1:1s
  - can we view 1:1s
  - use https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube to print the human description of recurrence
- change recurrence of an event
  - set end on current
  - create a new one
  - find an empty slot (in that user's time zone!)
- make a gem
  - ruby 2.3 and later (e.g., squiggly heredoc)
  - APL2 license (e.g., google)

## later?

- integrate with the zoom API to generate some zoom rooms
- how does the OOO feature work with free/busy?
